SmartBox is the modern way to get your old-fashioned paper mail. Never miss your important letters again! Smartbox will let you know immediately when there is new mail!

## What is it all about?
You do not need to make everything smarter, but sometimes it just makes so much sense. 

￼
The internet brought big changes in the way we communicate with each other. Do you remember the last time you sent a mail (an actual, not an e-mail)? Me neither. I guess, you check your bank account online? Yes, that’s you. You absolutely hate unaddressed advertising and so you keep it away from your postbox. In the end, you almost never receive any post and eventually just stop checking your postbox, because you think there is really no point. But then it happens. Your friend from college sends you an invitation for his wedding. It stays unread in the postbox and you just miss the event. Your friend is mad and you are thinking:

### “Why did I not check my mails?”
